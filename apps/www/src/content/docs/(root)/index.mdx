description: A modern wallet UI component library built on top of shadcn/ui.
---

**wallet/kit** is a set of accessible and composable Wallet UI components. Built on top of [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/), it's designed for you to copy, paste, and own.

**This is not a component library. It is how you build your wallet component library.**

You know how most traditional component libraries work: you install a package from NPM, import the components, and use them in your app.

This approach works well until you need to customize a component to fit your design system or require one that isn't included in the library. **Often, you end up wrapping library components, writing workarounds to override styles, or mixing components from different libraries with incompatible APIs.**

This is what wallet/kit aims to solve. It is built around the following principles:

## Open Code

wallet/kit hands you the actual component code. You have full control to customize and extend the components to your needs. This means:

- **Full Transparency:** You see exactly how each component is built.
- **Easy Customization:** Modify any part of a component to fit your design and functionality requirements.
- **AI Integration:** Access to the code makes it straightforward for LLMs to read, understand, and even improve your components.

_In a typical library, if you need to change a button's behavior, you have to override styles or wrap the component. With wallet/kit, you simply edit the button code directly._

## Composition

Every component in wallet/kit shares a common, composable interface. **If a component does not exist, we bring it in, make it composable, and adjust its style to match and work with the rest of the design system.**

_A shared, composable interface means it's predictable for both your team and LLMs. You are not learning different APIs for every new component. Even for third-party ones._

## Beautiful Defaults

wallet/kit comes with a collection of components that have carefully chosen default styles. They are designed to look good on their own and to work well together as a consistent system:

- **Good Out-of-the-Box:** Your UI has a clean and minimal look without extra work.
- **Unified Design:** Components naturally fit with one another. Each component is built to match the others, keeping your UI consistent.
- **Easily Customizable:** If you want to change something, it's simple to override and extend the defaults.

## AI-Ready

The design of wallet/kit makes it easy for AI tools to work with your code. Its open code and consistent API allow AI models to read, understand, and even generate new components.

_An AI model can learn how your components work and suggest improvements or even create new components that integrate with your existing design._

## Particles

We provide [particles](/particles)—pre-assembled components that combine multiple primitives into ready-to-use solutions. They're easy to customize, extend, or break apart when needed.
