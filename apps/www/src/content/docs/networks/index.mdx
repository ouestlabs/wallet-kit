**wallet/kit** is designed to support multiple blockchains through the Wallet Standard. This section documents the available blockchain integrations.

## Overview

The wallet kit uses a plugin-based architecture where each blockchain provides:

- Network definitions (mainnet, devnet, testnet, etc.)
- Chain-specific utilities (formatting, validation, etc.)
- Type definitions for type safety

## Available Integrations

### Solana

First-class support for Solana networks with utilities for formatting SOL amounts.

[Learn more about Solana integration →](/docs/networks/solana)

### Ethereum

Coming soon - Ethereum network support.

### Sui

Coming soon - Sui network support.

### Bitcoin

Coming soon - Bitcoin network support.

## Adding a New Blockchain

To add support for a new blockchain:

1. Create a network definition file (e.g., `lib/chains/ethereum/index.ts`)
2. Use `defineNetwork()` to create network factories
3. Export chain-specific utilities
4. Add the networks to `WalletProvider`

See the [Solana integration](/docs/networks/solana) for a complete example.
